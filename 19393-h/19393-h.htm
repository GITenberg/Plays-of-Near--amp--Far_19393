<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>


<p>Believing plays to be solely for the stage, I have never before allowed
any of mine to be printed until they had first faced from a stage the
judgment of an audience, to see if they were entitled to be called plays
at all. A successful production also has been sometimes a moral support
to me when some critic has said, as for instance of "A Night at an Inn,"
that though it reads passably it could never act.</p>

<p>But in this book I have made an exception to this good rule (as it seems
to me), and that exception is "The Flight of the Queen." I know too
little of managers and theatres to know what to do with it, and have a
feeling that it will be long before it is ever acted, and am too fond of
this play to leave it in obscurity. This beautiful story has been lying
about the world for countless centuries, without ever having been
dramatized. It is the story of a royal court, which I have merely
adapted to the stage. The date that I have given is accurate; it
happened in June; and happens every June; perhaps in some corner of the
reader's garden. It is the story of the bees.</p>

<p>As for "The Compromise of the King of the Golden Isles," it is just the
sort of play through which those that hunt for allegories might hunt
merrily, unless I mention that there are no allegories in any of my
plays.</p>

<p>An allegory I take to be a dig at something local and limited, such as
politics, while outwardly appearing to tell of things on some higher
plane. But, far from being the <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i> of some ponderously
profound thinker, I look on the allegory, if I have rightly defined it,
as being the one form of art that is narrowly limited in its application
to life. When the man whose cause it championed has been elected
alderman, when the esplanade has been widened, or the town better
lighted or drained, the allegory's work must necessarily be over; but
the truth of all other works of art is manifold and should be eternal.</p>

<p>Though there is no such land as the Golden Isles and was never any such
king as Hamaran, yet all that we write with sincerity is true, for we
can reflect nothing that we have not seen, and this we interpret with
our idiosyncracies when we attempt any form of art.</p>

<p>I set some store by the way in which the three lines about Zarabardes
are recited, though it is hard to explain in writing a matter of rhythm.
But the heartlessness of it can be indicated by a clear pronunciation of
the syllables, as though the people that utter these words had long been
drilled in a formula.</p>

<p>The third play, "Cheezo," tells of one of those rare occasions when it
is permissible for an artist, and may be a duty, to leave his wider art
in order to attack a definite evil. And the invention of "great new
foods" is often a huge evil.</p>

<p>"Cheezo" is a play of Right and Wrong, and Wrong triumphs. Were not this
particular Wrong triumphing at this particular date I should not have
thought it a duty to attack it, and were it easily defeated it would not
have been worth attacking.</p>

<p>I have seen it acted with a Stage Curate, rather weak and a little
comic; obviously such a man could be no match for Sladder. Hippanthigh
should be of stronger stuff than that: he is defeated because that
particular evil is, as I have said, defeating its enemies at present.
Nor could there be any drama in a contest between the brutal Sladder and
a Stage Curate; for the spark that we call humour, by whose light we see
much of life, comes as it were of two flints, and not of a flint and
cheese.</p>

<p>The three little plays that follow I will leave to speak for themselves,
as ultimately all plays have to do.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">The King's Politician</span>: A man has fled from the Emperor, and has taken
refuge in your Majesty's Court in that part of it called holy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">The King</span>: We must give him up to the Emperor.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: To-day a spearsman came running from Eng-Bathai seeking the
man who fled. He carries the barbed spear of one of the Emperor's
seekers.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: We must give him up.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: Moreover he has an edict from the Emperor demanding that the
head of the man who fled be sent back to Eng-Bathai.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Let it be sent.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: Yet your Majesty is no vassal of the Emperor, who dwells at
Eng-Bathai.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: We may not disobey the Imperial edict.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: Yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: None hath dared to do it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: It is so long since any dared to do it that the Emperor
mocks at kings. If your Majesty disobeyed him the Emperor would
tremble.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Ah.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: The Emperor would say, "There is a great king. He defies
me." And he would tremble strangely.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Yet&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: The Emperor would fear you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I would fain be a great king&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: You would win honour in his eyes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Yet is the Emperor terrible in his wrath. He was terrible in his
wrath in the olden time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: The Emperor is old.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: This is a great affront that he places upon a king, to demand a
man who has come to sanctuary in that part of my Court called holy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: It is a great affront.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>. <i>He abases himself.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Seeker</span>: O King, I have come with my spear, seeking for one that fled the
Emperor and has found sanctuary in your Court in that part called holy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: It has not been the wont of the kings of my line to turn men from
our sanctuary.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Seeker</span>: It is the Emperor's will.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: It is not <i>my</i> will.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Seeker</span>: Behold the Emperor's edict.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">King</span> <i>takes it. The</i> <span class="smcap">Seeker</span> <i>goes towards the door.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Seeker</span>: I go to sit with my spear by the door of the place called holy.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: The edict, the edict. We must obey the edict.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: The Emperor is old.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: True, we will defy him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: He will do nothing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: And yet the edict.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: It is of no importance.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Hark. I will not disobey the Emperor. Yet will I not permit him to
abuse the sanctuary of my Court. We will banish the man who fled from
Eng-Bathai. [<i>To his</i> <span class="smcap">Doom-Bearer</span>.] Hither, the Doom-Bearer; take the
black ivory spear, the wand of banishment, that lies on the left of my
throne, and point it at the man that shelters in the holy place of my
Court. Then show him the privy door behind the horns of the altar, so
that he go safely hence and meet not the Emperor's seeker.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Doom-Bearer</span> <i>bows and takes the spear on the flat of both his
hands. The shaft is all black, but the head is of white ivory. It is
blunt and clearly ceremonial. Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Politician</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Thus we shall be safe from the wrath of the Emperor, and the holy place
of my Court will not be violate.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Politician</span>: Had your Majesty scorned the Emperor it were better. He is
old and durst not take vengeance.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I have decided, and the man is banished.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>A</i> <span class="smcap">Herald</span> <i>marches in and blows his trumpet.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Herald</span>: The Ambassador of the Emperor.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>. <i>He bows to the King from his place near the
door.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: For what purpose to my Court from Eng-Bathai comes thus the
Ambassador of the Emperor?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: I bring to the King's Majesty a gift from the great Emperor,
[<span class="smcap">Ambassador</span> <i>and his men bow</i>] who reigns in Eng-Bathai, the reward of
obedience to his edict, a goblet of inestimable wine.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He signs and there enters a page bearing a goblet of glass. He has a
pretty complexion and yellow hair falling as low as his chin and curling
inwards. He wears a cerise belt round his tunic exactly matching the
wine in the goblet he carries.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">He prays you drink it, and to know that it was made by vintners whose
skill is lost, and stored in secret cellars over a hundred years; and
that the vineyards whence it came have been long since whelmed by war,
and only live now in legend and this wine.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: A gift, you say, for obedience.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: A gift from the old wine-gardens of the sun.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: How knew the Emperor that I had thus obeyed him?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: It has not been men's wont to disobey the Emperor.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Yet if I have sheltered this man in the holy place of my Court?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: If that be so the Emperor bids you drink out of this golden
goblet. [<i>He signs and it is brought on by a bent and ugly dwarf</i>] and
wishes you farewell.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Farewell, you say?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Farewell.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: What have you in the goblet?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: It is no common poison, but a thing so strange and deadly
that the serpents of Lebutharna go in fear of it. Yea travellers there
hold high a goblet of this poison, at arm's length as they go. The
serpents hide their heads for fear of it. Even so the travellers pass
the desert safely, and come to Eng-Bathai.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I have not sheltered this man.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: There is no need then for this Imperial gift.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He throws the liquid out of the goblet through the doorway on to the
marble. A great steam goes up.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Neither have I ordered that his head be sent back to Eng-Bathai.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Alas, for so rare a wine.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He pours it away.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I have banished him and he is safe. I have neither obeyed nor
disobeyed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: The Emperor therefore bids you choose the gift that he
honours himself by sending to your Court.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He signs. Enter a massive</i> <span class="smcap">Nubian</span> <i>with two cups.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">The Emperor bids you drink one of these cups.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The huge</i> <span class="smcap">Nubian</span> <i>moves up close to the</i> <span class="smcap">King</span> <i>holding up the two cups
on a tray.</i></p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Politician</span> <i>slinks off. Exit L.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: The cups are strangely alike.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Only one craftsman in the City of Smiths ever discerned a
difference. The Emperor killed him, and now no one knows.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: The potions also are alike.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Strangely alike. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">King</span> <i>hesitates.</i>] The Emperor bids
you choose his gift and drink.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: The Emperor has poisoned the cups!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: You greatly wrong the Emperor. Only one cup is poisoned.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: You say that one is poisoned?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Only one, O King! Who may say which?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: And what if I refuse to do this thing?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: There are tortures that the Emperor never names. They are
not spoken of where the Emperor is. Yet the Emperor makes a sign and
they are accomplished. He makes the sign with a certain one of his
fingers.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span> (<i>half to himself</i>): How wonderfully they have the look of wine.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: One is a wine scarcely less rare, scarcely less jubilant in
the wits of man, than that which alas is lost.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He glances towards the spot where he threw the other.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: And the other?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Who may say? It is the most treasured secret that the
Emperor's poisoners guard.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I will send for my butlers that are wise in wine and they shall
smell the cups.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Alas, but the Emperor's poisoners have added so wine-like a
flavour to their most secret draught, that no man may tell by this means
which is their work and which that inestimable wine.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: I will send for my tasters and they shall taste of the cups.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: Alas, so great a risk may not be run.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">King</span>: Risks are the duty of a king's tasters.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ambassador</span>: If they chanced to taste of the treasure of the Emperor's
poisoners&mdash;well. But if they, or <i>any</i> man of common birth, were to

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Is love here only, darling?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Here only, Golden Queen. Do any others elsewhere love as we.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: No, I think not.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Then how can pure love be elsewhere?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It is true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: On this clear peak that just enters Heaven love is and only here.
The rest is dreams.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Could we awake from love and find Earth true?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: No, no, no. Sweet Lady, let not such fancies alarm you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: And yet folks wake from dreams. It would be terrible.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: No, no, there are things too real for dreams. You cannot waken
from love. Dreams are of fantastic things, things fanciful and weak, and
things confused and intricate like Earth. When you think of them in
your dreams you see their unreality. But if love were not real what
could there be to wake to.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: True. How wise you are. It was but a fancy that troubled me.
(<i>Looking down.</i>) It was one of those dreams at dawn. It is faint and
far-off now.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Will you love me for ever, Golden Queen?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: For ever. Why not? You will love me for ever?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: For ever. I cannot help it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Let us look at the dream far off, in the dimness our thoughts
have forsaken.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Aye, let us look. It was a sad dream somewhat; and yet upon this
peak where all is love all that we see seems happy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: See the dream there. Look at those. They seem to walk dreamily as
they walk in the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It is because they have not love, which is only here.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Look! Look at those dreamers in the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: They are running.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Oh! Look!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: They are pursued.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: The brown ones are pursuing them with spears.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It is Prince Meliflor, Prince Moomoomon, Prince Ximenung that run
in the dream. And the Prince of Huz. The brown men are close.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: The brown ones are overtaking them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Yes, they are closer.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Look! Prince Ximenung!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Yes, he is dead in the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: The Prince of Huz?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Speared.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Still, still they are killing them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It is all the Hundred Princes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: They are killing them all.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: A sad sight once.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Once?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: I should have wept once.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It is so far off now.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It is so far, far off. We can only feel joy upon this holy
mountain.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Only joy. (<i>He sighs as he looks.</i>) Look! (<i>He sighs again.</i>)</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: There falls the poor Prince Meliflor.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: How huge a thrust it was with the great spear.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: He is dead.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Are you not happy?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: In your voice there seemed to sound some far-off thing. Some
strange thing. Was it sorrow?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: No; we are too high; sorrow cannot come. No grief can touch us
here, no woe drift up to us from the woes of Earth.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: I thought there was some strange thing in your voice, like
sorrows we have dreamed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: No, Golden Queen. Those fancied sorrows of dreams cannot touch
reality.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: You will never be sorry we have woken and left the dream of
Earth?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: No, glorious lady; nothing can bring me trouble ever again.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Not even I?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Never you, my Golden Zoomzoomarma, for on this sacred peak where
there is only love you cannot.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: We will dwell here for ever in endless joy.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span> (<i>looking down</i>): All dead now, all the Princes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Turn, my Prince, from the dream of Earth, lest trouble come up
from it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It cannot drift up here; yet we will turn from the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Let us think of endless joy upon the edge of heaven.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Yes, Queen; for ever in reality while all else dream away.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It is the years that make them drowsy. They dream to dream the
years away. Time cannot reach so high as here, the years are far below
us.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Far below us, making a dream and troubling it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: They do not know in the dream that only love is real.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: If time could reach us here we should pass, too. Nothing is real
where time is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: How shall we spend the calm that time does not vex, together here
for ever?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Holding your hand. (<i>She gives it.</i>) And kissing it often in the
calm of eternity. Sometimes watching, a moment, the dream go by; then
kissing your hand again all in eternity.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: And never wearying?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Not while eternity lingers here in heaven.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Thus we will live until the dream goes by and Earth has faded
under Aether Mountain.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: And then we shall watch the calm of Eternity.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: And you will still kiss my hand at times.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Yes, while eternity wiles Heaven away.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: The silence is like music on Aether Mountain.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It is because all is real. In the dream nothing was real. Music
had to be made and then soon passed trembling away. Here all things
always are as the desire of Earth, Earth's desire that groped among
fantasies finding them false.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Let us forget the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span> (<i>kissing her hand</i>): I have forgotten for ever.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Ah!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: What trouble has drifted up to you from Earth?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: An old saying.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: It was said in the dream.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It was true!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>She snatches her hand away.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Ah, I remember it. It was true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Touch not my hand. It was true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: None is worthy to touch my hand; no, none.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: By Aether Mountain, I will kiss your hand again! What is this
saying out of a dream that dares deny reality?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It is true! Oh, it is true!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Out of that hurried, aimless dream, that knows not its own end
even, you have brought me a saying and say it against love.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: I say it is true!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Nothing is true against love. Fate only is greater.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Then it is Fate.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Against Fate I will kiss your hand again.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Zoon</span>: Though it be death I kiss your hand again.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: It is certain death.</p>

dreamers, while I kiss your hand in heaven if only once again.</p>

little impatiently.</i></p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>The door opens very cautiously, and the head of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span> <i>is put
round it.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: O, Ermyntrude. Whatever are you doing here?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: I wanted to speak to father, mother.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: But you mustn't come in here. We mustn't disturb father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: I want to speak to father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Whatever about, Ermyntrude?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span> (<i>taps the arm of the chair</i>): O, nothing, mother. Only about
that idea of his.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: What idea, child?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, that idea he had, that&mdash;er&mdash;I was some day to marry a
duke.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: And why shouldn't you marry a duke, child? I am sure
father would make it worth his while.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O well, I don't think I want to, mother.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: But why not, Ermyntrude?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O well, you know Mr. Jones&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: That good man!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: &mdash;&mdash;did say that dukes were no good, mother. They oppress
the poor, I think he said.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Very true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Well, there you are.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Yes, yes, of course. At the same time, father had rather
set his heart on it. You wouldn't have any other reason now, child,
would you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: What more do you want, mother? Mr. Jones is a Cabinet
Minister; he must know what he's talking about.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: And I hear he's going to get a peerage.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span> (<i>with enthusiasm</i>): Well, I'm sure he deserves it. But
child, you mustn't talk to father to-day. You mustn't stay here any
longer.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But why not, mother?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Well, child, he's been smoking one of those big cigars
again, and he's absent-like. And he's been talking a good deal with Mr.
Splurge. It's one of his great days, I think, Ermyntrude. I feel sure it
is. One of those days that has given us all this money, and all these
fine houses, with all those little birds that his gentlemen friends
shoot. He has an idea!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, mother, do you really think so?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: I'm sure of it, child. (<i>Looking out.</i>) There! There he

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sladder</span>: Ah. I could never explain it to you, even if I knew. It is
business, child, business. It isn't everybody that can understand
business.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: I hear them coming, mother.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Sit down, Splurge.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Splurge, I am going to say to you now, what I couldn't talk
about with all those gardeners hanging about. And, by the way, Splurge,
haven't we bought rather too many gardeners?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: No, sir. The Earl of Etheldune has seven; we had to go one
better than him, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Certainly, Splurge, certainly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: So I bought ten for you, sir, to be on the safe side.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Ah, quite right, Splurge, quite right. There seemed to be
rather a lot, but that's quite right. Well, now to business.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I told you I'd invented a new name for a food.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Yes, sir. Cheezo.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, what have you been able to do about it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: I've had some nice little posters done, sir. I'm having it well
written up. I've got some samples here, and it looks like doing very
well indeed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Ah!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: It's a grand name, if I may say so, sir. It sounds so
classical-like with that "O" at the end; and yet anyone can see what
it's derived from, even if he's never learnt anything. It suggests
cheese to them every time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Let's see your samples.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Well, sir, here's one. (<i>Brings paper from pocket. Reads.</i>)
"What is Cheezo? Go where you may, speak with whom you will, the same
question confronts you. Cheezo is the great new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: No, Splurge. Cut that question bit. We must have no admission
on our part that there's anyone who doesn't know what Cheezo is. Cut it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: You're quite right, sir; you're quite right. That's a weak bit.
I'll cut it. (<i>He scratches it out. Reads.</i>) "Cheezo is the great new
food. It builds up body and brain."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: That's good.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: "There is a hundred times more lactic fluid in an ounce of
Cheezo than in a gallon of milk."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: What's lactic fluid, Splurge?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: I don't know, sir, but it's good stuff all right. It's the
right thing to have in it. It's a good man that I got to write this.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: All right. Go on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: "Cheezo makes darling baby grow."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Good. Very good. Very good indeed, Splurge.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Yes, I think that catches them, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Go on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: "Cheezo. The only food."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: "The only food"? I don't like that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: It will go down all right, sir, so long as the posters are big
enough.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Go down all right! I wasn't fool enough to suppose that it
wouldn't go <i>down</i> all right. What are posters for if the public doesn't
believe them? Of course it will go <i>down</i> all right.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: O, I beg your pardon, sir. Then what don't you quite like about
it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I might invent another food one of these days, and then where
should we be?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: I hadn't thought of that, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Out with it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: (<i>Scratches with pencil</i>). "Cheezo is made out of the purest
milk from purest English cows."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Y-e-s, y-e-s. I don't say you're wrong. I don't say you're
exactly wrong. But in business, Splurge, you want to keep more to
generalities. Talk about the bonds that bind the Empire, talk about the
Union Jack, talk by all means about the purity of the English cow; but
definite statements you know, definite statements&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: O, yes, I know, sir; but the police never interfere with
anything one puts on a poster. It would be bad for business, a jury
would never convict, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I didn't say they would; but if some interfering ass were to
write to the papers to say that Cheezo wasn't made from milk, we should
have to go to the expense of buying a dozen cows, and photographing
them, and one thing and another. (<i>He gets up and goes to cupboard.</i>)
Now, look here. I quite understand what you say, purity and all that,

earnest. On it is printed: "WON'T YOU HAVE SOME?" and on another part of
the poster "CHEEZO FOR PURITY."</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">You see. Your whole point's there. We state nothing and we can make the
dairymaid as suggestive as we like.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Yes, sir, that is excellent. Quite splendid.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: They shall look at that on every road and railway, where it
enters every town in England. I'll have it on the cliffs of Dover. It
shall be the first thing they see when they come back home, and the last
thing for them to remember when they leave England. I'll have it
everywhere. I'll rub their noses in it. And then, Splurge, they'll ask
for Cheezo when they want cheese, and that will mean I shall have the
monopoly of all the cheese in the world.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: You're a great man, sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I'll be a greater one, Splurge. I'm not past work yet. What
more have you got?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: I've rather a nice little poster being done, sir. A boy and a
girl looking at one another with a rather knowing look. There's a large
query mark all over the girl's dress. Then over the top in big letters
I've put: "What is the secret?" and in smaller letters: "I've got a bit
of Cheezo." It <i>makes</i> people look at it, the children's faces are so
wicked.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Good, Splurge. Very good. I'll have that one. I'll rub their
noses in that one.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Then I've got some things for the Press. (<i>Reads.</i>) "She:
'Darling.' He: 'Yes, wifey.' She: 'You won't forget, darling.' He: 'No,
wifey.' She: 'You won't forget to bring me some of that excellent
Cheezo, so nutritious, so nice for darling baby, to be had at all
grocers; but be sure that you find the name of Sladder on their
well-known pink wrappers.' He: 'Certainly, wifey.'" Just the usual
thing, sir, of course; only I have a very good little picture to go with
it, very suggestive indeed; I've made all the arrangements with the
Press and the bill-posters, sir. I think we'll make a big thing of it,
sir.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, Splurge, nothing remains to be done now, except to make
the Cheezo.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: How do you think of doing it, sir?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Do you know how they kill pigs in Chicago? No, you've not
travelled yet. Well, they get their pigs on a slide, one man cuts their
throats as fast as they go by, another shaves their bristles, and so on,
and so on; one man for each job, and all at it at once; they do it very
expeditiously. Well, there's an interfering fellow sent there by the
Government (we wouldn't stand him in England), and if a pig has a sign
of tuberculosis on him he won't let that pig go down. Now you'd think
that pig was wasted. He isn't. He goes into soap. Now, Splurge, how many
cakes of soap were used in the world last year?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Splurge</span>: Ah, here it is, sir. Soap statistics for the twelve months

on an average twenty cakes each per year. Then there are partial users,

million, sir.</p>

exactly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Mr. Sladder, many of my parishioners are acquainted with

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: What? Virilo?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Yes. They pay more for it than they pay for bread, because
they've been taught somehow, poor fools, that "they must have the best."
They've been made to believe that it makes them, what they call virile,
poor fools, and they're growing ill on it. Not so ill that I can prove
anything, and the doctor daren't help me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Are you aware, Mr. Hippanthigh, that if you said in public what
you're saying to me, you would go to prison for it, unless you can run
to the very heavy fine&mdash;damages would be enormous.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I know that, Mr. Sladder, and so I have come to you as the
last hope for my people.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Are you aware, Mr. Hippanthigh, that you are making an attack
upon business? I don't say that business is as pure as a surplice. But I
do say that in business it is&mdash;as you may not understand&mdash;get on or go
under; and without my business, or the business of the next man, who is
doing his best to beat me, what would happen to trade? I don't know
what's going to happen to England if you get rid of her trade, Mr.
Hippanthigh.... Well?... When we're broke because we've been doing
business with surplices on, what are the other countries going to do,
Mr. Hippanthigh? Can you answer me that?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: No, Mr. Sladder.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Ah! So I've got the best of you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Yes, Mr. Sladder. I'm not so clever as you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Glad you admit the point. As for cleverness it isn't that I've
so much of that, but I use what I've got. Well, have you anything more
to say?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Only to appeal to you, Mr. Sladder, on behalf of these poor
people.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Why. But you admitted one must have business, and that it can't
be run like a tea-party. What more do you want?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I want you to spare them, Mr. Sladder.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Spare them? Spare them? Why, what's the matter with them? I'm
not killing them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: No, Mr. Sladder, you're not killing them. The mortality
among children's a bit on the high side, but I wouldn't say that was
entirely due to your bread. There's a good many minor ailments among the
grown-up people, it seems to attack their digestion mostly, one can't
trace each case to its source; but their health and their teeth aren't
what they were when they had the pure wheaten bread.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: But there <i>is</i> wheat in my bread, prepared by a special
process.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Ah! It's that special process that does it, I expect.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, they needn't buy it if it isn't good.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Ah, they can't help themselves, poor fools; they've been
taught to do it from their childhood up. Virilo, Bredo and Weeto, that
are all so much better than bread, it's a choice between these three.
Bread is never advertised, or God's good wheat.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Mr. Hippanthigh, if I'm too much of a fool to sell my goods I
suffer for it; if they're such fools as to buy my Virilo, they suffer
for it&mdash;that is to say, you say they do&mdash;that is a natural law that may
be new to you. But why should I suffer more than them? Besides, if I
take my Virilo off the market just to oblige you, Mr. Hippanthigh, a
little matter of &pound;30,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O, don't mention it. Any little trifle to oblige! But if I did,
up would go the sales of Bredo and Weeto (which have nothing to do with
my firm), and your friends wouldn't be any better for that let me tell
you, for I happen to know how <i>they're</i> made.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I am not speaking of the wickedness of others. I come to
appeal to you, Mr. Sladder, that for nothing that <i>you</i> do, our English
race shall lose anything of its ancient strength, in its young men in
their prime, or that they should grow infirm a day sooner than God
intended, when He planned his course for man.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: So I am, child. So I am. Only I don't feel quite so glad as I
thought I was going to, now. I don't know why. He seems to have stroked
me the wrong way somehow.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: You said you'd give me whatever I liked.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: And so I will, child. So I will. A motor if you like, with
chauffeur and footman complete. We can buy anything now, and I wouldn't
grudge&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: I don't want a motor, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: What would you like to have?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, nothing, father, nothing. Only about that duke,
father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: What duke, Ermyntrude?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Mother said you wanted me to marry a duke some day, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Well I&mdash;er&mdash;I don't think I quite want to, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Ah! Quite so. Quite so. Quite so. And who <i>did</i> you think of
marrying?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well? (<span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span> <i>is silent.</i>) When I was his age, I had to
work hard for my living.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, father. How do you know what age he is?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O, I guessed he was 82, going to be 83 next birthday. But I
daresay I know nothing of the world. I daresay I may have been wrong.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, father, he's young.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Dear me, you don't say so. Dear me, you do surprise me. Well,
well, well, well. We do live and learn. Don't we? And what might his
name be now?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: It's Mr. Hippanthigh, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O-o-o! It's Mr. Hippanthigh, is it? O-ho, O-ho! (<i>He touches a
movable bell, shouting</i> "<span class="smcap">Splurge</span>!" <i>To his daughter or rather to
himself.</i>) We'll see Mr. Hippanthigh.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: What are you going to do, father?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: We'll see Mr. Hippanthigh. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Splurge</span>.) Splurge, run

to him. He's gone that way. Quick!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I've got something to say to <i>him</i> this time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Father! What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I'm going to give him What For.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But why, father?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Because he's been giving it to your poor old father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Be kind to him, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O, <i>I'll</i> be kind to him. I'll be <i>kind</i> to him. Just you wait.
I'll be <i>kind</i> to him!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But you wouldn't send him away, father. Father, for my sake
you wouldn't do that?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O, we haven't <i>come</i> to that yet.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But, but&mdash;you've sent for him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: O, I've sent for him to give him What For. We'll come to the
rest later.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But, when you do come to it, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Why, when we do come to it, if the young man's any good, I'll
not stand in my daughter's way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: O, thank you, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: And if he's no good (<i>firmly</i>) I'll protect my child from him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But, father, I don't want to be protected.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: If a man's a man, he must be some good at something. Well, this
man's chosen the clergyman job. I've nothing against the job, it's well
enough paid at the top, but is this young man ever going to get there?
Is he ever going to get off the bottom rung? How long has he been a
curate?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Eight years, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: It's a long time.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But, father, he would get a vicarage if it wasn't for the
bishop. The bishop stands in his way. It isn't nice of him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: If I'd quarrelled with the head of my firm when I was his age,
you wouldn't be getting proposals from a curate; no such luck. The
dustman would have been more in your line.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: But, father, he doesn't quarrel with the bishop. His
conscience doesn't let him believe in eternal punishment, and so he
speaks straight out. I do admire him so for it. He knows that if he was
silent he'd have had a good living long ago.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: The wife of the head of my firm believed in spirit rapping. Did
I go and tell her what an old fool she was? No, I brought her messages
from another world as regular as a postman.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Steps are heard outside the window.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Run along, my dear, now.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Ermyntrude</span>: Very well, father.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: The man that's going to look after my daughter must be able to
look after himself. Otherwise <i>I</i> will, till a better man comes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: You sent for me, Mr. Sladder?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Y-e-s&mdash;y-e-s. Take a chair. Now, Mr. Hippanthigh, I haven't
often been told off the way you told me off.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I felt it to be my duty, Mr. Sladder.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Yes, quite so. Exactly. Well, it seems I'm a thoroughly bad old
man, only fit to rob the poor, an out-and-out old ruffian.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I never said that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: No. But you made me feel it. I never felt so bad about myself
before, not as bad as that. But you, Mr. Hippanthigh, you were the
high-falutin' angel with a new brass halo, out on its bank holiday. Now,
how would clandestine love-making strike you, Mr. Hippanthigh? Would
that be all right to your way of thinking?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Clandestine, Mr. Sladder? I hardly understand you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I understand that you have been making love to my daughter.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I admit it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, I haven't heard you say anything about it to me before.
Did you tell her mother?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Er&mdash;no.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Perhaps you told me. Very likely I've forgotten it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: No.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, who <i>did</i> you tell?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: We&mdash;we hadn't told anyone yet.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Well, I think clandestine's the word for it, Mr. Hippanthigh. I
haven't had time in my life to bother about the exact<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">1</a> meanings of
words or any nonsense of that sort, but I think clandestine's about the
word for it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: It's a hard word, Mr. Sladder.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: May be. And who began using hard words? You came here and made
me out a pickpocket, just because I use a few tasty little posters which
sell my goods, and all the while you're trying on the sly to take a poor
old man's daughter away from him. Well, Mr. Hippanthigh?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I&mdash;I never looked at it in that light before, Mr. Sladder.
I never thought of it in that way. You have made me feel ashamed (<i>he
lowers his head</i>), ashamed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Aha! Aha! I thought I would. Now you know what it's like when
you make people ashamed of themselves. You don't like it when they do it
to you. Aha! (<span class="smcap">Sladder</span> <i>is immensely pleased with himself.</i>)</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Mr. Sladder, I spoke to you as my conscience demanded, and
you have shown me that I have done wrong in not speaking sooner about
our engagement. I would have spoken to you, but I could not say that and
the other thing in the same day. I meant to tell you soon;&mdash;well, I
didn't, and I know it looks bad. I've done wrong and I admit it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Aha! (<i>Still hugely pleased.</i>)</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: But, Mr. Sladder, you would not on that account perhaps
spoil your daughter's happiness, and take a terrible revenge on me. You
would not withhold your consent to our&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Wait a moment; we're coming to that. There's some bad animal
that I've heard of that lives in France, and when folks attack it it
defends itself. I've just been defending myself. I think I've shown you
that you're no brand-new extra-gilt angel on the top of a spire.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: O&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Quite so. Well, now we come on to the other part. Very well.
Those lords and people, they marry one another's daughters, because they
know they're all no good. They're afraid it will get out like, and
spread some of their damned medi&aelig;val ideas where they'll do harm. So
they keep it in the family like. But we people who have had the sense to
look after ourselves, we don't throw our daughters away to any young man
that can't look after himself. See?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I assure you, Mr. Sladder, I should&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: She's my only daughter, and if any of my grandchildren are
going to the work-house, they'll go to one where the master's salary is
high, and they'll go there as master.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I am aware, Mr. Sladder, that I have very little money; as
you would look at it, very little.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: It isn't the amount of money you've got as matters. The
question is this: are you a young man as money is any good to? If I died
and left you a million, would you know what to do with it? I've met men
what wouldn't last more than six weeks on a million. Then they'd starve
if nobody gave them another million. I'm not going to give my daughter
to one of that sort.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I was third in the classical tripos at Cambridge, Mr.
Sladder.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I don't give a damn for classics; and I don't give a damn for
Cambridge; and I don't know what a tripos is. But all I can tell you is
that if I was fool enough to waste my time with classics, third
wouldn't<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">2</a> be good enough for me. No, Mr. Hippanthigh, you've chosen
the church as your job, and I've nothing to say against your choice; its
a free country, and I've nothing to say against your job; it's well
enough paid at the top, only you don't look like getting there. I chose
business as my job, there seemed more sense in it; but if I'd chosen the
Church, I shouldn't have stuck as a curate. No, nor a bishop either. I
wouldn't have had an archbishop ballyragging me and ordering me about.
No. I'd have got to the top, and drawn big pay, and <i>spent</i> it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: But, Mr. Sladder, I could be a vicar to-morrow if my
conscience would allow me to cease protesting against a certain point
which the bishop holds to be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I know all about that. I don't care what it is that keeps you
on the bottom rung of the ladder. Conscience, you say. Well, it's a
different thing with every man. It's conscience with some, drink with
others, sheer stupidity with most. It's pretty crowded already, that
bottom rung, without me going and putting my daughter on it. Where do
you suppose I'd be now if I'd let my conscience get in my way? Eh?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Mr. Sladder, I cannot alter my beliefs.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Nobody asks you to. I only ask you to leave the bishop alone.
He says one thing and you preach another whenever you get half a chance;
it's enough to break up any firm.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Believing as I do that eternal punishment is incompatible
with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Now, Mr. Hippanthigh, that's got to stop. I don't mind saying,
now that I've given you What For, that you don't seem a bad young
fellow: but my daughter's not going to marry on the bottom rung, and
there's an end of that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: But, Mr. Sladder, can you bring yourself to believe in
anything so terrible as eternal punishment, so contrary to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Me? No.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: Then, how can you ask me to?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: That particular belief never happened to stand between me and
the top of the tree. Many things did, but they're all down below me now,
Mr. Hippanthigh, way down there (<i>pointing</i>) where I can hardly see
them. You get off that bottom rung as I did years ago.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I cannot go back on all I've said.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I don't want to make it hard for you. Only just say you believe
in eternal punishment, and then give up talking about it. You may say it
to me if you like. We'll have one other person present so that there's
no going back on it, my daughter if you like. I'll let the bishop know,
and he won't stand in your way any longer, but at present you force his
hand. It's you or the rules of the firm.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I cannot.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: You can't just say to me and my daughter that you believe in
eternal punishment, and leave me to go over to Axminster and put it
right with the bishop?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I cannot say what I do not believe.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: Think. The bishop probably doesn't believe it himself. But
you've been forcing his hand,&mdash;going out of your way to.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I cannot say it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span> (<i>rising</i>): Mr. Hippanthigh, there's two kinds of men, those
that succeed, those that don't. I know no other kind. You&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Hippanthigh</span>: I cannot go against my conscience.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sladder</span>: I don't care what your reason is. You are the second kind. I am
sorry my daughter ever loved a man of that sort. I am sorry a man of
that sort ever entered my house. I was a little, dirty, ragged boy. You
make me see what I would be to-day if I had been a man of your kind. I
would be dirty and ragged still. (<i>His voice has been rising during this

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: He'll tell us all about it, Sir Webley. I'm sure he'll&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Ah, Trundleben. Come and sit down here. Come and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Thank you, Sir Webley. I think I will. I don't walk quite as
well as I used, and what with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: What's all this we hear about this Mr. Shakespeare,
Trundleben?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, ah, well yes, yes indeed. Well, you see, Sir Webley, he
was put up for the Club. Mr. Henry put him up.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span> (<i>disapprovingly</i>): Oh, Mr. Henry.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes, yes, yes. Long hair and all that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: I'm afraid so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Writes poetry, I believe.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: I'm afraid so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well then, what does Mr. Newton do but go and second him,
and there you are, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Yes, a pretty state of things. Has he ... Does he ... What
is he?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: He seems to write, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Oh, he does, does he? What does he write?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, I wrote and asked him that, Sir Webley, and <i>he</i> said
plays.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Plays? Plays? Plays? I'm sure I never heard ... What plays?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I asked him that, Sir Webley, and he said ... he sent me a
list (<i>fumbling</i>). Ah, here it is.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He holds it high, far from his face, tilts his head back and looks
down his nose through his glasses.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">He says&mdash;let me see&mdash;"Hamelt," or "Hamlet," I don't know how he
pronounces it. "Hamelt, Hamlet"; he spells it "H-a-m-l-e-t." If you

if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: What's it all about?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, I gathered the scene was in Denmark.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Denmark! H'm! another of those neutrals!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Well, I wouldn't so much mind where the scene of the play
was put, if only it was a play one ever had heard of.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: But those men who have much to do with neutrals are rather the
men&mdash;don't you think, Sir Webley?&mdash;who&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Who want watching. I believe you're right, Neeks. And that
type of unsuccessful play-wright is just the kind of man I always
rather&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: That's rather what I feel, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: It wouldn't be a bad plan if we told somebody about him.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: I think I know just the man, Sir Webley. I'll just drop him a
line.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Yes, and if he's all right there's no harm done, but I
always suspect that kind of fellow. Well, what else, Trundleben? This is
getting interesting.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, Sir Webley, it's really very funny, but he sent me a
list of the characters in this play of his, "Hamelt," and, and it's
really rather delicious&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Yes? What is it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: He's got a <i>ghost</i> in his play. (<i>He-he-he-he-he</i>) A ghost!
He really has.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: What! Not on the stage?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Yes, on the stage!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Well, well, well.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: But that's absurd.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I met Mr. Vass the other day&mdash;it was his four hundredth
presentation of "The Nighty"&mdash;and I told him about it. He said that
bringing a ghost on the stage was, of course&mdash;er&mdash;ludicrous.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: What else does he say he's done?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Er&mdash;er&mdash;there's an absurdly long list&mdash;er&mdash;"Macbeth."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: "Macbeth." That's Irish.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Ah, yes. Abbey Theatre style of thing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I think I heard he offered it them. But of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: No, quite so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I gathered it was all rather a&mdash;rather a sordid story.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span> (<i>solemnly</i>): Ah!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span> (<i>focussing his list again</i>): Here's a very funny one. This
is funnier than "Hamlet." "The Tempest." And the stage directions are
"The sea, with a ship."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span> (<i>laughs</i>): Oh, that's lovely! That's really too good. The
sea with a ship! And what's it all about?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, I rather gathered that it was about a magician, and
he&mdash;he makes a storm.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: He makes a storm. Splendid! On the stage, I suppose.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh yes, on the stage.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Ha, ha! Very good! He'd have to be a magician to do that,
Trundleben.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Yes, indeed, Sir Webley; indeed he would, Mr. Neeks.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: But that stage direction is priceless. I'd really like to
copy that down if you'd let me. What is it? "The sea with a ship"? It's
the funniest bit of the lot.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Yes, that's it, Sir Webley. Wait a moment, I have it here.
The&mdash;the whole thing is "the sea with a ship, afterwards an island."
Very funny indeed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: "Afterwards an island"! That's very good, too. "Afterwards
an island." I'll put that down also. (<i>He writes.</i>) And what else,
Trundleben? What else?</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<span class="smcap">Trundleben</span> <i>holds out his list again.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: "The Tragedy of&mdash;of King Richard the&mdash;the Second."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: But <i>was</i> his life a tragedy? <i>Was</i> it a tragedy, Neeks?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: I&mdash;I&mdash;well I'm not quite sure; I really don't think so. But I'll
look it up.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Yes, we can look it up.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I think it was rather&mdash;perhaps <i>rather</i> tragic, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Oh, I don't say it wasn't. No doubt. No doubt at all. That's
one thing. But to call his whole life a tragedy is&mdash;is quite another.
What, Neeks?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Oh, quite another.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, certainly, Sir Webley. Tragedy is&mdash;er&mdash;is a very strong
term indeed, to&mdash;to apply to such a case.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: He was probably out poaching when he should have been
learning his history.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I'm afraid so, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: And what else, eh? Anything more?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, there are some poems, he says.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Holds up a list.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: And what are they about?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span> and <span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: H'm.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Left out altogether. And then there are "Sonnets," and&mdash;and
"Venus and Adonis," and&mdash;and "The Ph&#339;nix and the Turtle."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: The Ph&#339;nix and the what?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: The Turtle.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Oh. Go on&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: One called "The Passionate Pilgrim," another "A Lover's
Complaint."</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: I think the whole thing's very regrettable.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: I think so too, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span> (<i>mournfully</i>): And there've been no poets since poor
Browning died, none at all. It's absurd for him to call himself a poet.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Quite so, Trundleben, quite so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: And all these plays. What does he mean by calling them
plays? They've never been acted.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well&mdash;er&mdash;no, not exactly acted, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: What do you mean by not exactly, Trundleben?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Well, I believe they were acted in America, though of course
not in London.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: In America? What's that got to do with it. America? Why,
that's the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, yes, Sir Webley, I&mdash;I quite agree with you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: America! I daresay they did. I daresay they did act them.
But that doesn't make him a suitable member for the Olympus. Quite the
contrary.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Oh, quite the contrary.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, certainly, Sir Webley, certainly.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: I daresay "Macbeth" would be the sort of thing that would
appeal to Irish Americans. <i>Just</i> the sort of thing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Very likely, Sir Webley, I'm sure.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Their game laws are very lax, I believe, over there; they
probably took to him on account of his being a poacher.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I've no doubt of it, Sir Webley. Very likely.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: I expect that was just it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Well now, Trundleben; are we to ask the Olympus to elect a
man who'll come in here with his pockets bulging with rabbits.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Rabbits, and hares too.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: And venison even, if you come to that.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Yes indeed, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Thank God the Olympus can get its haunch of venison without
having to go to a man like that for it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes indeed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Indeed I hope so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Well now, about those plays. I don't say we've absolute
proof that the man's entirely hopeless. We must be sure of our ground.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes, quite so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, I'm afraid Sir Webley, they're very bad indeed. There
are some quite unfortunate&mdash;er&mdash;references in them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: So I should have supposed. So I should have supposed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes, yes, of course.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: For instance, in that play about that funny ship&mdash;I have a
list of the characters here&mdash;and I'm afraid, well&mdash;er,&mdash;er you see for
yourself. (<i>Hands paper.</i>) You see that is, I am afraid, in very bad
taste, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Certainly, Trundleben, certainly. Very bad indeed.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span> (<i>peering</i>): Er&mdash;er, what is it, Sir Webley?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span> (<i>pointing</i>): That, you see.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: A&mdash;a drunken butler! But most regrettable.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: A very deserving class. A&mdash;a quite gratuitous slight. I
don't say you mightn't see one drunken butler&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Quite so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: Yes, of course.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: But to put it boldly on a programme like that is practically
tantamount to implying that all butlers are drunken.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Which is by no means true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: There would naturally be a protest of some sort, and to have
a member of the Olympus mixed up with a controversy like that would
be&mdash;er&mdash;naturally&mdash;er&mdash;most&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Yes, of course, Sir Webley.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: And then of course, if he does a thing like that once&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: There are probably other lapses just as deplorable.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: I haven't gone through his whole list, Sir Webley. I often
feel about these modern writers that perhaps the less one looks the less
one will find that might be, er&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Yes, quite so.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Neeks</span>: That is certainly true.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Well, we can't wade all through his list of characters to
see if they are all suitable to be represented on a stage.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh no, Sir Webley, quite impossible; there are&mdash;there are&mdash;I
might say&mdash;hundreds of them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Sir Webley</span>: Good gracious! He must have been wasting his time a great
deal.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Trundleben</span>: Oh, a great deal, Sir Webley.</p>

there's anything to know.</p>

wear&mdash;you can get nothing out there&mdash;then I thought I'd have a look and
see how London was getting on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Splendid! How's everybody?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: All going strong.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: That's good.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span> (<i>seeing paper and ink</i>): But what are you doing?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Writing.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Writing? I didn't know you wrote.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Yes, I've taken to it rather.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say&mdash;writing's no good. What do you write?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, poetry.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Poetry! Good Lord!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Yes, that sort of thing, you know.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Good Lord! Do you make any money by it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: No. Hardly any.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say&mdash;why don't you chuck it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, I don't know. Some people seem to like my stuff, rather.
That's why I go on.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I'd chuck it if there's no money in it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Ah, but then it's hardly in your line, is it? You'd hardly
approve of poetry if there <i>was</i> money in it.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Oh, I don't say that. If I could make as much by poetry as I
can by betting I don't say I wouldn't try the poetry touch, only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Only what?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Oh, I don't know. Only there seems more sense in betting,
somehow.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Well, yes. I suppose it's easier to tell what an earthly horse
is going to do, than to tell what Pegasus&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: What's Pegasus?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, the winged horse of poets.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say! You don't believe in a winged horse, do you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: In our trade we believe in all fabulous things. They all
represent some large truth to us. An emblem like Pegasus is as real a
thing to a poet as a Derby winner would be to you.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say. (Give me a cigarette. Thanks.) What? Then you'd believe
in nymphs and fauns, and Pan, and all those kind of birds?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Yes. Yes. In all of them.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Good Lord!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: You believe in the Lord Mayor of London, don't you?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Yes, of course; but what has&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Four million people or so made him Lord Mayor, didn't they?
And he represents to them the wealth and dignity and tradition of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Yes; but, I say, what has all this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Well, he stands for an idea to them, and they made him Lord
Mayor, and so he is one....</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Well, of course he is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: In the same way Pan has been made what he is by millions; by
millions to whom he represents world-old traditions.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span> (<i>rising from his chair and stepping backwards, laughing and
looking at the</i> <span class="smcap">Poet</span> <i>in a kind of assumed wonder</i>): I say ... I say&nbsp;...
You old heathen ... but Good Lord&nbsp;...</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He bumps into the high screen behind, pushing it back a little.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Look out! Look out!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: What? What's the matter?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: The screen!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Oh, sorry, yes. I'll put it right.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He is about to go round behind it.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: No, don't go round there.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: What? Why not?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, you wouldn't understand.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Wouldn't understand? Why, what have you got?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, one of those things.... You wouldn't understand.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Of course I'd understand. Let's have a look.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Poet</span> <i>walks towards</i> <span class="smcap">Prattle</span> <i>and the screen. He protests no
further.</i> <span class="smcap">Prattle</span> <i>looks round the corner of the screen.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">An altar.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span> (<i>removing the screen altogether</i>): That is all. What do you
make of it?</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>An altar of Greek design, shaped like a pedestal, is revealed. Papers
litter the floor all about it.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say&mdash;you always were an untidy devil.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Well, what do you make of it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: It reminds me of your room at Eton.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: My room at Eton?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Yes, you always had papers all over your floor.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Oh, yes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: And what are these?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: All these are poems; and this is my altar to Fame.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: To Fame?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: The same that Homer knew.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Good Lord!</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Keats never saw her. Shelley died too young. She came late at
the best of times, now scarcely ever.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: But, my dear fellow, you don't mean that you think there really
is such a person?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: I offer all my songs to her.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: But you don't mean you think you could actually <i>see</i> Fame?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: We poets personify abstract things, and not poets only but
sculptors<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">7</a> and painters too. All the great things of the world are
those abstract things.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: But what I mean is, they're not really there, like you or me.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: To us these things are more real than men, they outlive
generations, they watch the passing of kingdoms: we go by them like
dust; they are still there, unmoved, unsmiling.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: But, but, you can't think that you could <i>see</i> Fame, you don't
expect to <i>see</i> it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Not to me. Never to me. She of the golden trumpet and Greek
dress will never appear to me.... We all have our dreams.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I say&mdash;what have you been doing all day?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: I? Oh, only writing a sonnet.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Is it a long one?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Not very.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: About how long is it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: About fourteen lines.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span> (<i>impressively</i>): I tell you what it is.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Yes?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I tell you what. You've been overworking yourself. I once got
like that on board the Sandhurst, working for the passing-out exam. I
got so bad that I could have seen anything.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Seen anything?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Lord, yes; horned pigs, snakes with wings; anything; one of
your winged horses even. They gave me some stuff called bromide for it.
You take a rest.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: But my dear fellow, you don't understand at all. I merely said
that abstract things are to a poet as near and real and visible as one
of your bookmakers or barmaids.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: I know. You take a rest.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Well, perhaps I will. I'd come with you to that musical comedy
you're going to see, only I'm a bit tired after writing this; it's a
tedious job. I'll come another night.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: How do you know I'm going to see a musical comedy?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: Well, where would you go? <i>Hamlet</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">8</a> on at the Lord
Chamberlain's. You're not going there.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Do I look like it?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: No.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Prattle</span>: Well, you're quite right. I'm going to see "The Girl from
Bedlam." So long. I must push off now. It's getting late. You take a
rest. Don't add another line to that sonnet; fourteen's quite enough.
You take a rest. Don't have any dinner to-night, just rest. I was like
that once myself. So long.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: So long.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Prattle</span>. <span class="smcap">de Reves</span> <i>returns to his table and sits down.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Good old Dick! He's the same as ever. Lord, how time passes.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><i>He takes his pen and his sonnet and makes a few alterations.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Well, that's finished. I can't do any more to it.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He rises and goes to the screen; he draws back part of it and goes up
to the altar. He is about to place his sonnet reverently at the foot of
the altar amongst his other verses.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">No, I will not put it there. This one is worthy of the altar.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He places the sonnet upon the altar itself.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">If that sonnet does not give me fame, nothing that I have done before
will give it to me, nothing that I ever will do.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He replaces the screen and returns to his chair at the table. Twilight
is coming on. He sits with his elbow on the table, his head on his hand,
or however the actor pleases.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Well, well. Fancy seeing Dick again. Well, Dick enjoys his life, so he's
no fool. What was that he said? "There's no money in poetry. You'd
better chuck it." Ten years' work and what have I to show for it? The
admiration of men who care for poetry, and how many of <i>them</i> are there?
There's a bigger demand for smoked glasses to look at eclipses of the
sun. Why should Fame come to me? Haven't I given up my days for her?
That is enough to keep her away. I am a poet; that is enough reason for
her to slight me. Proud and aloof and cold as marble, what does Fame
care for us? Yes, Dick is right. It's a poor game chasing illusions,
hunting the intangible, pursuing dreams. Dreams? Why, we are ourselves
dreams.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He leans back in his chair.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">We are such stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dreams are made on, and our little life<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He is silent for a while. Suddenly he lifts his head.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">My room at Eton, Dick said. An untidy mess.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>As he lifts his head and says these words, twilight gives place to
broad daylight, merely as a hint that the author of the play may have
been mistaken, and the whole thing may have been no more than a poet's
dream.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">So it was, and it's an untidy mess there (<i>looking at screen</i>) too.
Dick's right. I'll tidy it up. I'll burn the whole damned heap,</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He advances impetuously towards the screen.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">every damned poem that I was ever fool enough to waste my time on.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He pushes back the screen.</i> <span class="smcap">Fame</span> <i>in a Greek dress with a long golden
trumpet in her hand is seen standing motionless on the altar like a
marble goddess.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">So ... you have come!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>For a while he stands thunderstruck. Then he approaches the altar.</i></p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">Divine fair lady, you have come.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>He holds up his hand to her and leads her down from the altar and into
the centre of the stage. At whatever moment the actor finds it most
convenient, he repossesses himself of the sonnet that he had placed on
the altar. He now offers it to</i> <span class="smcap">Fame</span>.</p>

<p class="dialogue-cont">This is my sonnet. Is it well done?</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<span class="smcap">Fame</span> <i>takes it and reads it in silence, while the</i> <span class="smcap">Poet</span> <i>watches her

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: What?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: I&mdash;I&mdash;scarcely ... understand.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Fame</span>: You're IT.</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">de Reves</span>: But ... it is not possible ... are you she that knew Homer?</p>

<p class="dialogue"><span class="smcap">Fame</span>: Homer? Lord, yes. Blind old bat, 'e couldn't see a yard.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
